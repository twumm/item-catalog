# Item Catalog with User Authentication/Authorization

This item catalog app displays lists of categories and the items in these categories. A logged in user will be able to Create, Update and Delete categories/items they own.

## Getting Started

The application is written in python.
Clone the catalog folder onto your local machine in order to run the application.

### Prerequisites

To run the application, you need the following:


1. [Install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. [Install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
3. [Download the configuration for the VM](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/59822701_fsnd-virtual-machine/fsnd-virtual-machine.zip)
3. [Download the news database](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/August/57b5f748_newsdata/newsdata.zip)
4. Python
5. Git bash terminal

After installing 1, 2 and 3 above, from your terminal, inside the **vagrant subdirectory/configuration**(from 3 above), run the command **vagrant up**. This will allow Vagrant to download the Linux operating system and install it.

Run **vagrant ssh** when **vagrant up** is done in order to log in to your Linux VM.

The final step will be to **cd** into your **/catalog** directory

## Running the application

1. **cd** into the **/catalog** in your **vagrant environment**.
2. Run **python application.py**. This will start the item catalog server
3. In your browser, open __localhost:5000__
4. Explore the various pages, login to see and do more!
